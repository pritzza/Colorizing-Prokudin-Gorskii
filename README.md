To use, go into main.py, scroll down to the bottom, and enter the filenames of the images you want to colorize.

Input images should be in data/ directory and output images will be saved in results/ directory. 

If these directories don't exist, the code won't work.

If you want to display images at runtime, set display = True on line 129.
